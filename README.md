This is a Kosmo format 'spread' module.
It takes a CV input and a Spread input.
The Spread input is added to the CV input and sent to the + output.
The Spread input is also subtracted from the CV input and sent to the - output.
The Buffer output is a direct copy of the CV input, to avoid having to use multiples.

The Spread pot is used as an offset for the Spread input if a jack is plugged in, if not the Spread jack must be normalled to ground.
The Spread pot swings between +- 12v.
